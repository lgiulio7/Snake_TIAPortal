# Snake_TIAPortal

# This project is an implementation of the famous Snake game, made with TIA Portal V16 in Siemens SCL language (ST)

# The project contains both a PLC and an HMI application where the code can be simulated using S7-PLCSIM V16
# and WinCC Comfort / Advanced (panel used TP2200)

# The repo includes the single code files (for PLC) and the entire project that can be simulated

# The program includes:
# -Field 20x10 adjustable with system constants
# -Adjustable speed
# -Point system based on speed (with best score saving)
# -Video controls Up/Down/Left/Right
# -Start/Pause/Stop game buttons
